# sc_tutorial_translations

This is me learning Overtone by studying Supercollider. In order to get productive with Overtone and do what I want to do with it (you'll see that repo later) I need to get solid with my domain-specific knowledge of how Supercollider actually works. Buffers, midi, all of that.

I'm relatively new to Clojure as well, so translating basic (and extremely-well-written, thanks Eli Fieldsteel!) SC tutorials into Clojure is the perfect exercise for me.

## Usage

I dunno, make some weird noises. Use for your reference as you pick up SC and Overtone simultaneously. That's what I did, except I wrote some code. Now you don't have to! But maybe you should. Up to you.
